# Neural-Networks-for-Credit-Risk-Evaluation

This notebook reimplements, investigates and improves the credit risk evaluation neural network method proposed by Adnan Khashman in his paper Neural Networks for Credit Risk Evaluation: investigation of different neural models and learning schemes.
The credit risk evaluation system uses supervised neural network models based on the back propagation algorithm. Three neural network models are tested to generate a result of application scoring, a binary result of acceptance or rejection. Nine learning schemes with different training-to-validation data ratios have been considered. For this purpose, the data used are real German credit dataset, published on UCI Machine Learning data repository. The Comparasion of the implementation result generates the result of optimal parameters of this risk evaluation system. Besides the processure provide in this paper, which is rather simple, more criterias of model evaluation and improvement on the model is given in the notebook.
